<h3><span class="section-number">2.1.5. </span>4. Types of membership and members of the association<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-membership-and-members-of-the-association" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Members of the association may be natural and juridical persons who wish to support and help to pursue the goals of the association. In order to give members the option of withdrawing from the active support of the continuing development of Adempiere without giving up their membership, the following types of memberships are available:
*   Active members are natural persons who support the association’s mission and the realisation of the association’s goals through cooperation and, in so doing, assume the full obligations of an association member. In particular, it is expected that they will participate in cooperations and members’ meetings and exercise voting rights.
*   Passive members are natural and juridical persons who declare their support of the association’s mission and goals through their membership in the association, but opt not to exercise the rights of active members, in this case, the exercising of voting rights. Juridical persons shall designate a natural person as their representative in order to exercise any still applicable rights and obligations.
*   Sponsoring members are natural and juridical persons who promote the association’s mission and goals, particularly through a financial or non-financial contribution. At their own request, they may be listed on the association’s web site and have the right to participate in members’ meetings without acquiring voting rights.</p></li>
<li><p>Active membership may be acquired upon the recommendation of an active member subject to the approval of two other active members by means of a resolution of the members’ meeting or the active members through an Internet vote with a simple majority. The main decision-making criterion for acceptance is supposed to be the candidate for acceptance’s commitment shown over a longer period of time and resulting contributions made in the sense of the association’s goals.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon his own request to the management board, an active member may change his membership to a passive membership. In the aforementioned obligations of an active member are not fulfilled for two successive ordinary members’ meetings, his membership shall automatically change into a passive membership. A passive member may request that the management board grant him active membership. The management board shall rule regarding the acceptance of sponsoring members.</p></li>
<li><p>A passive member can apply for active membership at the board in case it used to an active member in the past. Otherwise 4.2 apply to gain active membership.</p></li>
<li><p>Sponsoring membership is given by the board.</p></li>
<li><p>The membership shall end through resignation, expulsion or death; for juridical persons, also through the loss of legal personality. The resignation of a member is possible only on 31 December of each year. Such a resignation shall be announced by means of a written declaration submitted to the management board while providing four weeks’ notice.</p></li>
<li><p>The instrument for expulsion from the association shall be reserved to critical situations whereby clarification of the issue should take precedence. Expulsion shall be made with immediate effectiveness upon a resolution of the management board. The following may be reasons for an expulsion:
*   A major violation of a member against the provisions of this charter as well as well as goals and purposes of the association after an unsuccessful attempt at clarification as well as
*   Despite multiple warnings, payments of membership dues in arrears for a timeframe of 12 months.</p></li>
<li><p>Before the adopting of a resolution, the member must be given the opportunity to provide a legal justification or take a statement of position. An objection to the exclusion may be submitted to the management board within four weeks upon which the next members’ meeting shall rule. Until a decision is made by the members’ meeting, the rights and obligations of the member shall be suspended.</p></li>
<li><p>If a member leaves the association or the association is dissolved, no claim to the reimbursement of financial assets that have been contributed shall apply.</p></li>
